## Overview

This is a lap counter that uses Bluetooth Low Energy signal strength to
approximate how far away the athlete is from the phone.

This project was originally designed as a hands-free method for swimmers
to count laps. However, it works well for runners on a track as well.

## Hardware Requirements

To use this project, the user needs the following:

1. An Android device running at least version 4.4 (KitKat)
2. A Bluetooth Low Energy device to connect to. A small bluetooth
    beacon around the size of the Puck.js or smaller is optimal.

### Disclaimer

If you use this system in a pool, you are responsible for waterproofing your
own Bluetooth tag!

## Software Requirements

1. Android Studio

## Installation

1. Open the project in Android Studio
2. Click the Run button (green triangle on the top right)
3. Plug in the Android phone and the IDE will install it onto the device once
    it builds.

This may require installing other dependencies. Follow any instructions
provided in the IDE

## Other Documentation

The requirements document, design document and test plan are submitted to
our advisor through Drexel's Blackboard Learn course management website.

Upon the completion of this senior design project, we will likely add them
to this repository.
